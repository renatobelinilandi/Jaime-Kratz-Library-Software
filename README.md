Credits:
This program was developed and implemented in the library of Jaime Kratz School, a school located in the city of Campinas, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. It was created entirely voluntarily and alone by Renato Belini Landi. The idea arose from the need to improve the management of the school's library collection and facilitate access to books for all members of the school community.
