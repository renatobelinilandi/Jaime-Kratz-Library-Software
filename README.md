Credits:
This program was developed and applied in the library of the Jaime Kratz school, a school located in the city of Campinas, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. It was created completely voluntarily and alone by Renato Belini Landi. The idea arose from the need to create a school library collection management system, which did not exist, and facilitate access to books for all members of the school community.
